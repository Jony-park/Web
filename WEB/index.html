<h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 40px;">
The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is the world's dominant software platform.[1] It was
originally a hypertext document management system[2] accessed over the Internet.[3]
The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by
a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.
Web resources may be any type of downloaded media, but web pages are hypertext documents formatted in
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Special HTML syntax displays embedded hyperlinks with URLs, which permits users
to navigate to other web resources.
